# CS61A
bo's solution for CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Spring 2018

# Introduction
CS61A is a famous computer science course provided by UC Berkeley. The objectif of course is to teach about programming and the concepts involed in the programming. 
By following the online version of courses, I did the reading, homeworks and projets, I learned a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.
The main language I used in the course is the Python 3.

# Contents (Done)
### Reading
	1.1. Introduction of programming in Python 3
	1.2. Introduction of basic expression and build-in function
	1.3. How to define functions
	1.4. How to design functions
	1.5. Introduction of testing
	1.6. Introduction of high-order functions and how to design it
	1.7. Iteration and recursion
	2.1. Introduction of data types
	2.2. Introduction of data abstractions
	2.3. Introduction of sequence: lists, iteration and processing
	2.4. How to do data manipulation 
	2.5. Introduction of Object-oriented programming (OOP)
	2.6. Classes and Objects

### Homeworks
	01. Practice if and loop
	02. Design basic functions 
	04. Design recursive functions

### Projets
	1. Hog: develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game. In the game, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. 
	This project use control statements and higher-order functions together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of Composing Programs.
	
	2. Map: create a visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. 
	In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). Specifically, the visualization you will be constructing is a Voronoi diagram. 
	This project uses concepts from Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.3 of reading
	
	3. Ants: create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath.
	This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of reading. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.
		
# Lessons Learned
- Use of Python 3 language
- Use of functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.
- Writing doctest to understand the program and to speed up de debugging process
